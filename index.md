# Ongoing Campaigns

## Student Centre in Pedra Branca, Amapá, Brazil

School education in and around the indigenous land (terra indigena) in the federal state of Amapá in Brazil is offered in a modular fashion, where the students’ presence in classrooms is limited to four-weeks modules in each academic year. Students’ contact with the school itself is therefore restricted to the periods in which the teaching modules take place. Throughout the rest of the year, they are completely alone in their learning process. The positive aspect of modular teaching is that it interferes less in the traditional calendar that governs planting, harvesting, hunting and fishing activities. However, students remain long periods without being able to count on anyone to help them in their studies. Young indigenous students, as well as the students from the adjacent rural communities are left alone trying to cope with great difficulties in learning and in completing their various schoolwork. This problem is even more evident in the phases of final essays and dissertations, with the great distances existing between the student’s usual residence and that of the supervising teacher.

Through the construction of a student support centre we hope to be able to reduce this distance, accompanying those students with revision, homework, notions of computer use and help with completion of assignments. The Support Centre will also serve as a space for exchanging good practices between indigenous and non-indigenous students in the field of sustainable family farming. The motivation for this project is purely philanthropic, without any political or religious ties. The centre will be open to all students of the surrounding communities, regardless of their ethnic origin or belief.

In order to carry out this project, one of the founding members of the NGO Feigenhain, with long teaching experience in schools in indigenous villages in French Guiana and in Brazil, has identified a plot of three hectares of land in Tucano (1.098N, 52.403W) in the state of Amapá in Brazil, which is a rural settlement community adjacent to the indigenous land (terra indigena). The strategic choice of this location will allow the support centre to be easily reached by students not only from the indigenous land (terra indigena) but also from all its surrounding communities. The bus that makes the Macapá-Tucano line makes it easy for volunteer teachers to reach the Support Centre.

The structure to be built will be very simple: the centre will have a classroom, a small library, a computer with access to satellite internet, a kitchen, bathroom and a small accommodation for students, visitors and volunteer teachers. It will also be necessary to dig a small well.

The estimated cost for the construction of the Support Centre and purchase of the equipment is 12 thousand euros. We are transparent concerning our bookkeeping and regular reports will be made available for consultation online.

Contributors to this project who have some knowledge to offer to students in the region can stay at the Support Centre, give some of their time to students and then take the opportunity to get to know the region.

Please contribute to make this project come true.

## Long-term individual support

Feigenhain local staff identifies individual Brazilian Amerindians who are struggling with life and puts them in contact with sponsors who are willing to lend them a hand. We focus particularly on students and on elderly people.

Very few Amerindians students manage to make it to university, and the rare exceptions who do, face great difficulties in financing their studies. Your sponsorship helps them pay for their accommodation in town, for food and books.

Elderly indigenous people struggle when they suffer from new illnesses that traditional medicine is unable to deal with. Often penniless, they perish facing long queues to have access to public health care in Brazil. Your sponsorship helps elders to pay for medical exams, medication and to purchase food when necessary.

We provide you with regular reports on how the person you are helping is doing, and you may also choose to be in direct contact with them.

The way it works is simple: all you need to do is to set up a standing order for a monthly bank transfer to Feigenhain and we will look after the rest. You might choose whether or not to have your name listed in our website next to the person you are sponsoring. We follow up very closely to make sure your contribution is being spent for the right purpose, and we send you regular reports on that person.

### Kuhupi Waurá 
Kuhupi Waurá is a young Amerindian from the Aldeia Pyulaga located in the Parque Indígena do Xingú in Brazil. Both his parents live in the Amerindian village, but Kuhupi has a dream which is to become a nurse. His plans are to go back to Xingú after he graduates.


[![Kuhupi Waurá](/assets/img/campaigns/kuhupi1-300x225.jpeg)](/assets/img/campaigns/kuhupi1.jpeg)

He needs the equivalent of 300 Euros per month in order to pay for accommodation and food in Cárceres (Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil), where his university is. You can help sponsor Kuhupi. We will keep you informed on how he has been doing at Uni. You can also be in direct contact with him. All you need to do is to set up a standing order for a monthly bank transfer in Euros to Feigenhain and we will look after the rest.

You might choose whether or not to have your name listed in our website next to his picture.

# Successfully concluded Campaigns

## Help Manoel
Manoel lives in the suburbs of Macapá, in the state of Amapá, one of the poorest regions of Brazil. His whole family depends on him. In poor health, for over two years Manoel has been unable to work with his right arm which was seriously injured by a dog bite. Manoel dreams of going back to work in order to help his family, but he has no resources for a surgery, which costs about 700 Euros. Our campaign will continue until we have enough money to pay for it. You can help us achieve this dream. By contributing to this specific campaign, your entire donation will be used for Manoel’s surgery. No sum will be used to cover other expenses or operating costs of the Association, which are covered by general donations, and members’ private resources.
